# Pet App

<!-- ![App Logo](path/to/app_logo.png) -->

## Description

This is a work in progress project. I plan to implement an application that allows owners to register their pets in accounts and provides notifications when a pet goes missing.

Currently I have set up a minimal UI that allows users to create an account using their email address and this is stored under Firebase Auth. I am also able to add the user's account details to a Firestore database, which I will then populate with more details of the user.

<!-- To enable Firebase Authentication, follow these steps:

1. Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Enable the Authentication service.
3. Configure the authentication providers you want to use (e.g., email/password, Google, Facebook).
4. Update the Firebase configuration in your app's code. -->
